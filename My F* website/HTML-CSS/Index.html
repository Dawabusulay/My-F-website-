        <h1>This is a website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's perfect.</aside>
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what more do you need?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think they're extraordinary. You believe your 13-megabyte homepage with fancy animations will win you an award. You think your massive jQuery file and 83 polyfills will make Internet Explorer 7 perform better. Think again. Let me describe the perfect website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>It's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>It works on all screens</li>
            <li>It looks consistent across all browsers</li>
            <li>It's accessible to everyone who visits</li>
            <li>It's readable and gets your point across (if you have one)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>So guess what:</h3>
        
        <p>You’re overcomplicating things. Look at this website. It’s a website. Why do you need to animate a decorative banner when someone hovers over it? You spent hours adding animations, which made your site heavier, and many users won’t even notice them. And let’s not forget visually impaired users who won’t see them at all.</p>
        
        <p>You didn’t realize it, but this might just be your perfect website. Here’s why:</p>
        
        <h2>It’s lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page is lighter than the logo on your WordPress site. Did you really load 100kb of jQuery UI just to animate the background color of a div? Did you load seven different font weights just to display "Hello" in huge letters on your homepage? That’s unnecessary.</p>
        
        <h2>It’s responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You thought you needed media queries to make a website responsive, but you don’t. Responsive simply means the site works on any screen size. This site doesn’t care if you’re on an iMac or an old flip phone.</p>
        
        <h2>It works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this. You can read it. It makes sense. It has proper hierarchy. It uses HTML5 tags, so both you and your browser understand the structure. That’s semantics.</p>
        
        <p>It has actual content. Your site has a few headlines and a link to your portfolio, spread across seven screens, with a button that demonstrates how clever your scroll animations are. This is simpler and better.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Open this in any browser, even older ones. It works.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You’ve probably never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like someone who’s never let their hair grow out and doesn’t know their natural style, you don’t know what a true website is. All you’ve seen are overly complex designs masking what should be simple text conveying a message. This is a real, stripped-down website. Take a good look. It’s beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is satire.</h3>
        
        <p>I’m not saying every site should look exactly like this. What I’m saying is that most issues with websites are <strong>self-inflicted</strong>. Websites are inherently functional, fast, and accessible. We’re the ones who make them slow, cumbersome, and overcomplicated.</p>
